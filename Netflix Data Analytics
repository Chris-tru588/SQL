In this SQL code I am querying a database that is holding netflix data to answer questions about the data.


SELECT * FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" LIMIT 5;

SELECT people.show_id, titles.title, titles.type, people.director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id=titles.show_id;

--how many movie titles?
SELECT COUNT("title")
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

--when was the most recent batch or tv shows/movies added to the database
SELECT max(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

--movies and tvshows in alphabetical order
SELECT "title"
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY "title";

--who was the director for the movie "Bright Star"?
SELECT people.director, 
titles.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id=titles.show_id
WHERE titles.title = 'Bright Star';

--what is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1;
