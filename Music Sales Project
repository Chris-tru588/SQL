#In this project I queried data from a dataset that had a ton of different information all the way from artist and their albums to customers and employees


--Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName || ' ' || LastName as FullName, CustomerId, Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country != 'USA'
 
--Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil'

--Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT cust.FirstName || ' ' || cust.LastName as FullName, inv.invoiceId, inv.invoicedate, inv.billingcountry
FROM customers cust
JOIN invoices inv
ON cust.customerId = inv.customerId
WHERE Country = 'Brazil'

--Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent'

--Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct billingcountry
FROM invoices

--Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT cust.FirstName || ' ' || cust.LastName as FullName, inv.invoiceid
FROM employees emp, customers cust, invoices inv
WHERE emp.employeeid = cust.supportrepid AND cust.customerid = inv.customerid AND emp.title = 'Sales Support Agent'

--Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT SUM(inv.total), cust.firstname || ' ' || cust.lastname as FullName, cust.country, emp.firstname || ' ' || emp.lastname as SalesAgent
FROM customers cust, invoices inv, employees emp
WHERE inv.customerid = cust.customerid AND cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid AND emp.title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY FullName

--How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'

--What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(inv_i.unitprice) * quantity, 1 ) as totalSales
from invoice_items inv_i, invoices inv
WHERE inv_i.invoiceid = inv.invoiceid AND inv.invoicedate LIKE '2009%'

--I realized mid way threw this problem there are two ways to awnser this question
SELECT ROUND(SUM(total), 1) as totalSales
FROM invoices
WHERE invoicedate LIKE '2009%'

--Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, inv.invoicelineid
FROM invoice_items inv, tracks t
WHERE inv.trackid = t.trackid

--list of the names of artist who have more than one album and how many albums they have 
SELECT art.name, COUNT(al.title) albumcount
FROM albums al, artists art
WHERE al.artistid = art.artistid 
GROUP BY art.name
HAVING COUNT(al.title) > 1
